# Class 7: JavaScript Data Structures

**Duration:** 2.5 hours teaching + 30 minutes assessment  
**Total:** 3 hours

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this class, students will be able to:
- Create and manipulate arrays using built-in methods
- Work with objects and understand property access
- Use destructuring for cleaner code
- Apply the spread operator effectively
- Implement common data manipulation patterns

## Topics Covered

### 1. Arrays Fundamentals (45 minutes)
- Array creation: literal notation and Array constructor
- Array indexing and length property
- Adding elements: `push()`, `unshift()`, direct assignment
- Removing elements: `pop()`, `shift()`, `splice()`
- Finding elements: `indexOf()`, `includes()`, `find()`
- Array iteration basics:
  - Traditional for loop with arrays
  - `for...of` loop for arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Array type checking with `Array.isArray()`

### 2. Advanced Array Methods (50 minutes)
- Transformation methods:
  - `map()`: creating new arrays with transformed data
  - `filter()`: creating new arrays with filtered data
  - `reduce()`: aggregating array data into single values
- Iteration methods:
  - `forEach()`: executing functions for each element
  - `some()` and `every()`: testing array elements
- Sorting and reversing:
  - `sort()` method and custom compare functions
  - `reverse()` method
- Array manipulation:
  - `slice()` vs `splice()`
  - `concat()` for joining arrays
  - `join()` for converting to strings
- Method chaining techniques

### 3. Objects and Properties (45 minutes)
- Object creation: literal notation and Object constructor
- Property access: dot notation vs bracket notation
- Adding, modifying, and deleting properties
- Object methods and `this` keyword
- Object property enumeration:
  - `for...in` loop
  - `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.entries()`
- Nested objects and complex structures
- Object comparison and reference vs value
- JSON: `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`

### 4. Modern JavaScript Features (30 minutes)
- Destructuring assignment:
  - Array destructuring with rest elements
  - Object destructuring with renaming
  - Nested destructuring patterns
  - Default values in destructuring
- Spread operator (`...`):
  - Spreading arrays into function arguments
  - Cloning arrays and objects
  - Merging arrays and objects
- Rest parameters in functions
- Template literals with embedded expressions
- Shorthand property names and methods in objects

## Assignment/Test (30 minutes)
**Practical Assessment:**
1. Create a student management system using objects and arrays
2. Implement array filtering and mapping for data processing
3. Build a shopping cart with add/remove/calculate functionality
4. Use destructuring and spread operator in practical scenarios
5. Convert between different data formats (arrays to objects, etc.)

**Quiz Topics:**
- Array methods and their purposes
- Object property access and manipulation
- Destructuring syntax and use cases
- Spread operator applications
- When to use different data structures
