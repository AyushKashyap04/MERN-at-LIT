# Class 6: JavaScript Fundamentals Part 2

**Duration:** 2.5 hours teaching + 30 minutes assessment  
**Total:** 3 hours

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this class, students will be able to:
- Implement conditional logic with if/else statements
- Use different types of loops effectively
- Handle errors with try/catch blocks
- Apply logical operators in complex conditions
- Control program flow with break and continue

## Topics Covered

### 1. Conditional Statements (45 minutes)
- `if` statement syntax and usage
- `else` and `else if` chains
- Nested conditional statements
- Logical operators in conditions:
  - AND (`&&`) operator
  - OR (`||`) operator  
  - NOT (`!`) operator
- Truthy and falsy values in JavaScript
- Short-circuit evaluation
- `switch` statement:
  - Syntax and case matching
  - `break` statements
  - `default` case
  - When to use switch vs if/else

### 2. Loops and Iteration (60 minutes)
- `for` loop structure and components:
  - Initialization, condition, increment
  - Loop variable scope
  - Common patterns and use cases
- `while` loop:
  - Syntax and when to use
  - Avoiding infinite loops
  - Loop conditions and boolean logic
- `do...while` loop:
  - Difference from while loop
  - Use cases for do-while
- `for...in` loop (introduction):
  - Iterating over object properties
- `for...of` loop (introduction):
  - Iterating over arrays and iterables
- Loop control statements:
  - `break` to exit loops
  - `continue` to skip iterations
- Nested loops and performance considerations

### 3. Error Handling (35 minutes)
- Understanding JavaScript errors:
  - Syntax errors vs runtime errors
  - Common error types
- `try...catch` statement:
  - Basic syntax and usage
  - Catching specific errors
  - Error object properties
- `finally` block:
  - When and why to use finally
  - Cleanup operations
- `throw` statement:
  - Creating custom errors
  - Error handling best practices
- Debugging strategies:
  - Console logging
  - Browser debugger
  - Common debugging techniques

### 4. Control Flow Patterns (30 minutes)
- Guard clauses and early returns
- Combining conditionals with loops
- Loop optimization techniques
- Common algorithmic patterns:
  - Finding maximum/minimum values
  - Counting occurrences
  - Validation loops
- Performance considerations:
  - When to use different loop types
  - Avoiding unnecessary iterations

## Assignment/Test (30 minutes)
**Practical Assessment:**
1. Create a grade calculator using conditional statements
2. Build a number guessing game with loops and conditionals
3. Implement input validation with error handling
4. Write a function that processes arrays using different loop types
5. Debug provided code with logical errors

**Quiz Topics:**
- Conditional statement syntax and logic
- Loop types and their appropriate use cases
- Error handling mechanisms
- Truthy/falsy values and type coercion
